            <p>Antibodies are one of the most important proteins of the adaptive immune system. They specifically recognize and bind to antigens to block their function, remove them from the bloodstream, or mark pathogens for immune cells14. To recognize a variety of antigens, antibodies exhibit an immense genetic diversity of over 1013 unique sequences in humans and evolve within each organism in response to antigen exposure31. Understanding the mechanisms behind the generation of antibody sequences is fundamental to illuminating the function of our immune system and leveraging it for the treatment of disease.</p>

            <p>Glioblastoma is a hard-to-treat malignant brain tumor characterized by high cellular diversity. Previous research has identified expression meta-modules that define cellular states within Glioblastoma and cells that appear to be in transition between these states. In this project, we tested whether trajectory inference methods, developed to analyze cell differentiation processes, could be utilized to identify trajectories connecting these cell states. While some reservations remain about the validity of this approach, the tested methods successfully identified the expected trajectories and revealed gene expression changes along them. These findings suggest that trajectory inference techniques might offer valuable insights into Glioblastoma’s cellular heterogeneity.</p>

            <p>Record-seq is a recently developed technology that enables bacterial cells to
                record their own transcrip- tional activity into DNA and preserve it over 
                time. Record-seq readout consists of deep sequencing and data interpretation
                using a dedicated computational analysis pipeline. This report describes improvements
                to and experiments with the Record-seq data analysis pipeline. 
                First, we worked on the primary analysis pipeline, augmenting its 
                capability to detect recorded sequences from reads using updated approximate 
                string matching methods. Next, we tested several methods for normalizing counts 
                distributions during secondary analysis to apply differential expression analysis
                tools developed for RNA sequencing. Two new normalization methods, namely plasmid
                normalization, and percentile normalization were implemented.</p>
