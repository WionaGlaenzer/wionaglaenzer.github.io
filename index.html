            <p>Antibodies are one of the most important proteins of the adaptive immune
                 system. They specifically recognize and bind to antigens to block their
                  function, remove them from the bloodstream, or mark pathogens for immune
                   cells. To recognize a variety of antigens, antibodies exhibit an immense
                    genetic diversity of over 10<sup>13</sup> unique sequences in humans
                     and evolve within each organism in response to antigen exposure.
                      Understanding the mechanisms behind the generation of antibody 
                      sequences is fundamental to illuminating the function of our immune 
                      system and leveraging it for the treatment of disease. <br/> <br/> 
                      For my Master's thesis I trained antibody language models on data 
                      from the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) database and compared the performance
                    when training data from different species is used.</p>

            <p>Glioblastoma is a hard-to-treat malignant brain tumor characterized 
                by high cellular diversity. Previous research has identified expression
                meta-modules that define cellular states within Glioblastoma and cells
                that appear to be in transition between these states. In this project,
                I tested whether trajectory inference methods, developed to analyze 
                cell differentiation processes, could be utilized to identify trajectories
                connecting these cell states. While some reservations remain about
                the validity of this approach, the tested methods successfully 
                identified the expected trajectories and revealed gene expression
                changes along them. These findings suggest that trajectory inference
                techniques might offer valuable insights into Glioblastoma’s cellular 
                heterogeneity. <br/> <br/>

            <p>Record-seq is a recently developed technology that enables bacterial cells to record their own transcriptional
                activity into DNA and preserve it over time. Record-seq readout consists of deep sequencing and data interpretation
                using a dedicated computational analysis pipeline. In this project made improvements
                to and conducted experiments with the Record-seq data analysis pipeline. 
                First, I worked on the primary analysis pipeline, augmenting its 
                capability to detect recorded sequences from reads using updated approximate 
                string matching methods. Next, I tested several methods for normalizing counts 
                distributions during secondary analysis to apply differential expression analysis
                tools developed for RNA sequencing. Two new normalization methods, namely plasmid
                normalization, and percentile normalization were implemented.
